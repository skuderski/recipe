        <p><em>Pierogi are filled dumplings, made by wrapping unleavened dough around a filling, and occasionally flavored with a savory or sweet garnish and cooking in boiling water.</em></p>
        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <div class="three">
            <li>Dough</li>
            <li>Minced meat</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
        </div>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the onion, finely chop the garlic (with a knife and not a garlic press).</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan, and the onions, add a pinch of salt and cook for 5-10 minutes until softened.</li>
            <li>Add the meat and 1/4 cup of broth. Cook until warmed up. Season with salt and pepper. Add more broth if the mixture is too dry.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 2 parts.</li>
            <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press edges together, sealing and crimping with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

                Cook the pierogi in batches (for a 8-inch (21 cm) pot I cook about 10-12 dumplings at a time). When they float to the water surface cook them for 1 minute, then remove from the water with a slotted spoon.</li>
        </ol>
